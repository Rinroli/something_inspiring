Here you can find several algorithms written in **C++**.

Some info can be found in [help.txt](help.txt) and [changelog.md](logs/changelog.md).

Currently, some clustering algorithms are implemented:

* **DBSCAN**
* **Minimal spanning tree** - can find *epsilon* for DBSCAN
* **K-means**
* **K-means with kernels**
* **EM-algorithm** - and produce *gif*-image with all steps

Before data analysis, you can work with normally distributed clouds by generating and working with a **buffer** - *rotate*, *shift*, *scale*.
