Commands:
    HELP >> show help (this message)

    INFO >> show information about field, clouds and clusters

    EXIT >> exit program

    SAVE(index) >> save points to file for gnuplot (default).
        Index is the number of FindCluster to print.
        Default value is the whole field.
        Files for call from gnuplot are 'clus_gnu.plt' for FindCluster
                                        'gnuplot.plt' for whole Field

    GEN_CLOUD(mx=0, my=0, sx=1, sy=1) or GC >> create normally distributed cloud

    HIST or HIST(clu/clo, id_cl) >> output to the gnuplot (data/gnu_hist.plt) histogram of x and y coords of points.
        By default use all points on the field. Can be called for cluster or cloud - by id (can be checked by command *INFO*)

    MATRIX or ANALYSIS >> set readonly 'Analysis' mod and create distance matrix.

    INFOFC >> display info about cluster bundles.

    BINARY >> create binary matrix by delta (default = 0.1).

    DBSCAN >> create binary matrix by delta and k - number of neighbors (default delta = 0.1, k = 10).
    
    WAVE(number_b_matrix) >> find clusters using wave-algorithm on binary matrix (default the last one)

    DBSCAN(number_b_matrix) >> find clusters using dbscan-algorithm on binary matrix (default the last one)

    DIBINARY or DIB (index) >> print graph with point marks and edges of the binary matrix to the file. 
        Index is the number of binary matrix, default is the last one.
        Can be called by gnuplot as *gnuplot data/graph.plt*.
